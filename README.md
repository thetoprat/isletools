### Download the Installer

1.  Go to the [**Isle App Tools Releases page on GitHub**](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_OR_ORG/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/releases/latest).
    **IMPORTANT:** Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME_OR_ORG` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username/organization and repository name in the link above and in the badges.

2.  The installer is designed to be straightforward and will guide you through the process.
3.  You might see a brief green installation UI, which is normal for this type of installer.

### First Launch

* When you launch Isle App Tools for the first time, it might take a moment to initialize.
* You may be prompted to log in or register an account. This is required to activate the Save Editor functionality.

## Automatic Updates

Isle App Tools includes an automatic update mechanism powered by Squirrel.Windows.

* When a new version of the app is released on GitHub, your installed application will **automatically download updates in the background**.
* You will typically be prompted to **restart the application** to apply the new version.
* This ensures you always have the latest features and bug fixes without needing to manually re-download and reinstall the entire app.

## Basic Troubleshooting

* **"App not launching" / "Missing dependencies"**:
    * Ensure your Windows operating system is up-to-date.
    * Temporarily disable your antivirus/firewall to see if it's blocking the installer or app launch, then add an exception for Isle App Tools.
* **"Firebase connection errors" / "License validation issues"**:
    * Verify your internet connection is active and stable.
    * Ensure no firewall is blocking access to `*.googleapis.com` or `*.firebaseapp.com` domains.
* **"Copy/Paste not working"**: Due to security limitations in certain application contexts, copy/paste might only work reliably within designated input fields or editable areas.
